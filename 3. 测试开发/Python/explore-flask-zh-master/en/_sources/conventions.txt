There are a number of conventions in the Python community to guide the
way you format your code. If you've been developing with Python for a
while, then you might already be familiar with some of these
conventions. I'll keep things brief and leave a few URLs where you can
find more information if you haven't come across these topics before.

Let's have a PEP rally!
-----------------------

A **PEP** is a "Python Enhancement Proposal." These proposals are
indexed and hosted at python.org. In the index, PEPs are grouped into a
number of categories, including meta-PEPs, which are more informational
than technical. The technical PEPs, on the other hand, often describe
things like improvements to Python's internals.

There are a few PEPs, like PEP 8 and PEP 257 that are meant to guide the
way we write our code. PEP 8 contains coding style guidelines. PEP 257
contains guidelines for docstrings, the generally accepted method of
documenting code.

PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. I recommend that you
read it and apply its recommendations to your Flask projects (and all of
your other Python code). Your code will be much more approachable when
it starts growing to many files with hundreds, or thousands, of lines of
code. The PEP 8 recommendations are all about having more readable code.
Plus, if your project is going to be open source, potential contributors
will likely expect and be comfortable working on code written with PEP 8
in mind.

One particularly important recommendation is to use 4 spaces per
indentation level. No real tabs. If you break this convention, it'll be
a burden on you and other developers when switching between projects.
That sort of inconsistency is a pain in any language, but white-space is
especially important in Python, so switching between real tabs and
spaces could result in any number of errors that are a hassle to debug.

PEP 257: Docstring Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PEP 257 covers another Python standard: **docstrings**. You can read the
definition and recommendations in the PEP itself, but here's an example
to give you an idea of what a docstring looks like:

::

   def launch_rocket():
      """Main launch sequence director.

      Locks seatbelts, initiates radio and fires engines.
      """
      # [...]

These kinds of docstrings can be used by software such as Sphinx to
generate documentation files in HTML, PDF and other formats. They also
make it easier to understand your code.

.. note::

   - `PEP 8 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
   - `PEP 257 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_
   - `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_, the documentation generator created by the same folks who brought us Flask

Relative imports
----------------

Relative imports make life a little easier when developing Flask apps.
The premise is simple. Let's say you want to import the ``User`` model
from the module *myapp/models.py*. You might think to use the app's
package name, i.e. ``myapp.models``. Using relative imports, you would
indicate the location of the target module relative to the source. To do
this we use a dot notation where the first dot indicates the current
directory and each subsequent dot represents the next parent directory.
Listing~ illustrates the diffence in syntax.

::

   # myapp/views.py

   # An absolute import gives us the User model
   from myapp.models import User

   # A relative import does the same thing
   from .models import User

The advantage of this method is that the package becomes a heck of a lot
more modular. Now you can rename your package and re-use modules from
other projects without the need to update the hard-coded import
statements.

In my research I came across a Tweet that illustrates the benefit of
relative imports.

   Just had to rename our whole package. Took 1 second. Package relative imports FTW!

.. note::

   You can read a little more about the syntax for relative imports from this section in `PEP 328 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/#guido-s-decision>`_.

Summary
-------

-  Try to follow the coding style conventions laid out in PEP 8.
-  Try to document your app with docstrings as defined in PEP 257.
-  Use relative imports to import your app's internal modules.
