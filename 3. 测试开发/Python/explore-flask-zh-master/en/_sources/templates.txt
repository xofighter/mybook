Templates
=========

   :alt: Templates

While Flask doesn't force us to use any particular templating language,
it assumes that we're going to use Jinja. Most of the developers in the
Flask community use Jinja, and I recommend that you do the same. There
are a few extensions that have been written to let us use other
templating languages, like `Flask-Genshi <http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Genshi/>`_ and `Flask-Mako <http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mako/>`_.
Stick with the default unless you have a good reason to use something else. Not knowing the
Jinja syntax yet is not a good reason! You'll save yourself a lot of time and headache.

.. note::

   Almost all resources imply Jinja2 when they refer to "Jinja." There was a Jinja1, but we won't be dealing with it here. When you see Jinja, we're talking about this: `http://jinja.pocoo.org/ <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_

A quick primer on Jinja
-----------------------

The Jinja documentation does a great job of explaining the syntax and
features of the language. I won't reiterate it all here, but I do want
to make sure that you see this important note:

    There are two kinds of delimiters. ``{% ... %}`` and
    ``{{ ... }}``. The first one is used to execute statements such as
    for-loops or assign values, the latter prints the result of the
    expression to the template.

How to organize templates
-------------------------

So where do templates fit into our app? If you've been following along
at home, you may have noticed that Flask is really flexible about where
we put things. Templates are no exception. You may also notice that
there's usually a recommended place to put things. Two points for you.
For templates, that place is in the package directory.

::

    myapp/
        __init__.py
        models.py
        views/
        templates/
        static/
    run.py
    requirements.txt

::

   templates/
       layout.html
       index.html
       about.html
       profile/
           layout.html
           index.html
       photos.html
       admin/
           layout.html
           index.html
           analytics.html

The structure of the *templates* directory parallels the structure of
our routes. The template for the route *myapp.com/admin/analytics* is
*templates/admin/an-alytics.html*. There are also some extra templates
in there that won't be rendered directly. The *layout.html* files are
meant to be inherited by the other templates.

Inheritance
-----------

Much like Batman's backstory, a well organized templates directory
relies heavily on inheritance. The **parent template** usually defines a
generalized structure that all of the **child templates** will work
within. In our example, *layout.html* is a parent template and the other
*.html* files are child templates.

You'll generally have one top-level *layout.html* that defines the
general layout for your application and one for each section of your
site. If you take a look at the directory above, you'll see that there
is a top-level *myapp/templates/lay-out.html* as well as
*myapp/templates/profile/layout.html* and
*myapp/templat-es/admin/layout.html*. The last two files inherit and
modify the first.

Inheritance is implemented with the ``{% extends %}`` and
``{% block %}`` tags. In the parent template, we can define blocks which
will be populated by child templates.

::

    {# _myapp/templates/layout.html_ #}

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        {% block body %}
            <h1>This heading is defined in the parent.</h1>
        {% endblock %}
        </body>
    </html>

In the child template, we can extend the parent template and define the
contents of those blocks.

::

    {# _myapp/templates/index.html_ #}

    {% extends "layout.html" %}
    {% block title %}Hello world!{% endblock %}
    {% block body %}
        {{ super() }}
        <h2>This heading is defined in the child.</h2>
    {% endblock %}

The ``super()`` function lets us include whatever was inside the block
in the parent template.

.. note::

   For more information on inheritance, refer to the `Jinja Template Inheritence documentation <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#template-inheritance>`_.

Creating macros
---------------

We can implement DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles in our templates
by abstracting snippets of code that appear over and over into
**macros**. If we're working on some HTML for our app's navigation, we
might want to give a different class to the "active" link (i.e. the link
to the current page). Without macros we'd end up with a block of
``if ... else`` statements that check each link to find the active one.

Macros provide a way to modularize that code; they work like functions.
Let's look at how we'd mark the active link using a macro.

::

    {# myapp/templates/layout.html #}

    {% from "macros.html" import nav_link with context %}
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
        {% block head %}
            <title>My application</title>
        {% endblock %}
        </head>
        <body>
            <ul class="nav-list">
                {{ nav_link('home', 'Home') }}
                {{ nav_link('about', 'About') }}
                {{ nav_link('contact', 'Get in touch') }}
            </ul>
        {% block body %}
        {% endblock %}
        </body>
    </html>

What we are doing in this template is calling an undefined macro —
``nav_link`` — and passing it two parameters: the target endpoint
(i.e. the function name for the target view) and the text we want to
show.

.. note::

    You may notice that we specified ``with context`` in the import
    statement. The Jinja **context** consists of the arguments passed to the
    ``render_template()`` function as well as the Jinja environment context
    from our Python code. These variables are made available in the template
    that is being rendered.

    Some variables are explicitly passed by us, e.g.
    ``render_template("index.html", color="red")``, but there are several
    variables and functions that Flask automatically includes in the
    context, e.g. ``request``, ``g`` and ``session``. When we say
    ``{% from ... import ... with context %}`` we are telling Jinja to make
    all of these variables available to the macro as well.

.. note::

    -  All of the global variables that are passed to the Jinja context by
       Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/templating/#standard-context}
    -  We can define variables and functions that we want to be merged into
       the Jinja context with context processors:
       http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/templating/#context-processors

Now it's time to define the ``nav_link`` macro that we used in our template.

::

    {# myapp/templates/macros.html #}

    {% macro nav_link(endpoint, text) %}
    {% if request.endpoint.endswith(endpoint) %}
        <li class="active"><a href="{{ url_for(endpoint) }}">{{text}}</a></li>
    {% else %}
        <li><a href="{{ url_for(endpoint) }}">{{text}}</a></li>
    {% endif %}
    {% endmacro %}

Now we've defined the macro in *myapp/templates/macros.html*. In this macro
we're using Flask's ``request`` object — which is available in
the Jinja context by default — to check whether or not the current
request was routed to the endpoint passed to ``nav_link``. If it was,
than we're currently on that page, and we can mark it as active.

.. note::

    The from x import y statement takes a relative path for x. If our
    template was in *myapp/templates/user/blog.html* we would use
    ``from "../macros.html" import nav_link with context``.

Custom filters
--------------

Jinja filters are functions that can be applied to the result of an
expression in the ``{{ ... }}`` delimeters. It is applied before that
result is printed to the template.

::

   <h2>{{ article.title|title }}</h2>


In this code, the ``title`` filter will take ``article.title`` and return
a title-cased version, which will then be printed to the template. This
looks and works a lot like the UNIX practice of "piping" the output of
one program to another.

.. note::

   There are loads of built-in filters like ``title``. See `the full list <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#builtin-filters>`_ in the Jinja docs.

We can define our own filters for use in our Jinja templates. As an
example, we'll implement a simple ``caps`` filter to capitalize all of
the letters in a string.

.. note::

   Jinja already has an ``upper`` filter that does this, and a ``capitalize`` filter that capitalizes the first character and lowercases the rest. These also handle unicode conversion, but we'll keep our example simple to focus on the concept at hand.

We're going to define our filter in a module located at
*myapp/util/filters.py*. This gives us a ``util`` package in which to
put other miscellaneous modules.

::

   # myapp/util/filters.py

   from .. import app

   @app.template_filter()
   def caps(text):
       """Convert a string to all caps."""
       return text.uppercase()

In this code we are registering our function as a Jinja filter by using
the ``@app.template_filter()`` decorator. The default filter name is
just the name of the function, but you can pass an argument to the
decorator to change that.

::

   @app.template_filter('make_caps')
   def caps(text):
       """Convert a string to all caps."""
       return text.uppercase()

Now we can call ``make_caps`` in the template rather than ``caps``:
``{{ "hello world!"|make_caps }}``.

To make our filter available in the templates, we just need to import it
in our top-level *\_\_init.py\_\_*.

::

    # myapp/__init__.py

    # Make sure app has been initialized first to prevent circular imports.
    from .util import filters

Summary
-------

-  Use Jinja for templating.
-  Jinja has two kinds of delimeters: ``{% ... %}`` and ``{{ ... }}``.
   The first one is used to execute statements such as for-loops or
   assign values, the latter prints the result of the contained
   expression to the template.
-  Templates should go in *myapp/templates/* — i.e. a directory inside
   of the application package.
-  I recommend that the structure of the *templates/* directory mirror
   the URL structure of the app.
-  You should have a top-level *layout.html* in *myapp/templates* as
   well as one for each section of the site. The former extend the
   latter.
-  Macros are like functions made-up of template code.
-  Filters are functions made-up of Python code and used in templates.
